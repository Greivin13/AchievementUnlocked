## Description
   Achievement Unlocked is a website that allows users to connect with eachother and discuss anything gaming. The "End Game" for Achievement Unlocked is to create a webapp that allows users to sync their profiles from every launcher and platform to create a hub for all of their gaming accolades, as well as a social media app for gamers to connect with other gamers about anything gaming related by means of forums, profile posts, reviews, and comments. Future additions are set to be made to make Achievement Unlocked grow into the vision we have for it. 

## Use Instructions
   When opening the site, the users will find themselves on the home page. Once on the home page, they're able to find the login button located at the top left of the page, which will then be asked to input their email address and password.

## Description
   Achievement Unlocked is a website that allows users to connect and discuss with other users about anything relating to videogames. When opening the site, the users will find themselves on the home page. Once on the home page, they're able to find the login button located at the top left of the page, which will then be asked to input their email address and password. If they're a new user, they will find a signup button directly underneath the login credentials. Future additions are set to be made to make Achievement Unlocked grow.
